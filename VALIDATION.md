# Release verification

Measured on 2026-10-06. This verifies client portability and the existing Pi workflow; it is not a new model comparison.

| Check | macOS Apple Silicon | Linux ARM64 container |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Workflow Python tests | 159 passed | 159 passed |
| Web Python tests | 20 passed | 20 passed |
| JavaScript tests | 46 passed | 46 passed |
| Total | **225 passed** | **225 passed** |

The Linux image installs its own Python 3.12 environment, Node 26, locked npm dependencies and Python packages. It needs `procps` for cancellation and same-host RSS sampling; the Dockerfile includes it. Cancellation treats exited zombies as stopped and waits for live owned descendants after sending signals. macOS uses a separate clean virtual environment and local npm installation. GitHub Actions repeats these CPU checks on macOS and Ubuntu; release measurements above are local runs, not a claim about completed CI.

## Genuine Linux Pi → Mac Qwen proof

A Linux Pi worker connected over HTTP to Qwen on the model Mac. It received one frozen task: repair `double(value)` while preserving the signature and satisfying numeric, keyword, sequence and invalid-input acceptance cases. The external acceptance fixture remained immutable.

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Atomic correctness | Passed all four acceptance tests |
| Changed source | Only `arithmetic.py` |
| Fresh shadow / final scope gate | Passed; no violations |
| Total execution time | 85.668 seconds |
| Model requests | 1 |
| Native input / output tokens | 7,473 / 373 |
| Reported reasoning tokens | 276 |
| Native prompt processing | 114.623 tokens/s |
| Native generation | 23.086 tokens/s |
| Native first-token delay | 65.585 seconds |
| Sampled model process RAM peak | 33.724 GiB |
| Native allocation high-water mark | 41.549 GiB |
| Server capacity / worker window | 98,304 / 32,768 tokens |
| Worker input / total output limits | 16,384 / 8,192 tokens |
| Reasoning / thinking cap | Medium / 512 tokens |
| Generation / KV | MTP3 / normal KV |

RAM is sampled process RSS; native allocation is a separate backend high-water metric and can include earlier work. The cold first-token delay includes processing the actual selected prompt, not preallocating the entire 96k context. This was a single smoke test, with a 2 GiB Linux VM running on the model host; it does not establish broad speed or quality rankings.

Run a fresh live proof when the Qwen server is idle:

```sh
MYPI_SERVER_URL=http://YOUR_SERVER:8000 \
  agent-workflow-v2/.venv/bin/python examples/smoke.py /new/evidence/directory
```

The script creates an isolated project, a bounded task, immutable tests, progress logs, memory samples and a measured result. It copies session evidence outside the ephemeral worker location. No production project is edited.

## Connection and UI verification

- Real HTTP tests verify endpoint identity/capacity, rejected changes preserving the previous setting, bearer authentication, exact forwarding of thinking/output controls, streaming completion and same-host RSS.
- A genuine Pi RPC session ran `/server IP:8000` without a generation request. Its actual model registry and active model refreshed to the LAN `/v1` base, retaining 98,304 capacity.
- The mypi web UI created a new conversation, handled `/server`, showed the saved endpoint in chat and deleted the test conversation. The original UI on 8099 remained running.
- Repeating the gateway start command reused the gateway. The existing native model PID and generation settings remained unchanged.
- The publication audit excluded private auth, endpoint preferences, sessions, user projects, model weights, logs and installed dependencies. The bundled text tokenizer has an attribution, license and SHA-256 manifest.
